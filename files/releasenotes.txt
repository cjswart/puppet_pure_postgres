1.1.3: Added syslog
- Added optional logging to syslog facility
  pure_postgres::do_syslog 				boolean 
  pure_postgres::syslog_ident 		identity for syslog record (default: pgpure)
  pure_postgres::syslog_facility	facility for syslog (default: LOCAL0)

1.1.2: Added custom fact
- New custom ruby script will add 'pure_postgres_db_count' fact on nodes with postgres installed. 

1.1.1: Cleanup, and fixed pg_hba file
- Moved some manifests to subfolders, for clarity
- Commented many files, templates, scripts
- Fixed pg_hba script
  - ipv6 wasn't working properly
  - sorting of output hba file is now nicer
  - some other minor things

1.1.0: Cleanup, release notes, commenting, and copyrights
- Cleanup with puppet lint
- Added a line to some files and templates stating that the file is managed by puppet
- Added a copyright statement to manifests, files and templates
- Added release notes. They are shipped by puppet to the node
  so that operators know which version of puppet module is currently managing this node.

1.0.2: Autotune, autorestart and undef pure_repmgr::barman_server issue
- Autotune feature added
- Autorestart can now be enabled / disabled
- Fixed issue when pure_repmgr::barman_server is undef.

1.0.1: Added barman support and modified postgres service to better fit to puppet way
- Changes as where required for barman setup:
  - added pure_postgres::ssh module which exchanges ssh keys between servers.
    This was part of pure_repmgr::ssh, but that was split and this part was transferred and enhanced so
    that keys can also be exchanged between barman server and postgres database servers.
- The service part is modified to better fit the puppet way of resource management.
  - A init parameter sets if the service should be managed by the module or not.
    -  Managed: pure_postgres starts the service
    -  Unmanaged: pure_postgres::start can be notified, but will not be started by default
  - pure_postgres::started is now a definition. Both pure_postgres::start and pure_postgres::restart use it to check that postgres is up after class is finished
  - pure_postgres::reload and pure_postgres::restart are refreshonly
  - All the service stuff is moved to the pure_postgres::service module (to fit to proper module layout)
    pure_postgres::service now rather initializes the services that taking action

- Log connects and disconnects to postgresql.log

0.1.5: Getting there
- Initial master does not rely on package for datadir initialization anymore, 
  but starts out similar as initial standby and does an extra initdb.
- Both initial master and initial standby can be used with different location for data / pg_xlog. 
  Both are resolved with symlinks.
- Fixed a great lot of puppet-lint warnings and errors
- both start and reload are now optionally refreshonly. 
  Moved 'check postgres was started' from start class to new started class.
